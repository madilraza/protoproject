PROTOTHON!

Deployed to: http://protoproject.herokuapp.com/
Access the ARCode markers from http://protoproject.herokuapp.com/marker.html

This project uses WebRTC API's to enable control of Audio filters using ARCodes. Hit the start button and then load up
the markers using your mobile device. Based on the rotation angle of the ARCode, the audio filter settings will be adjusted.

Current work in progress includes enabling peer-to-peer video to allow for multiple people to control each others 
audio.
